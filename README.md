# Predict Titanic
Predict Survival on the Titanic

In this project I predicted who passengers survived. For that: (i) analyzed the data I had about the passengers (statistical values of the variables, correlation between variables, missing values and outliers); (ii) I dealt with missing values and outliers; (iii) I treated some variables; (iv) applied some predict models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K Neighbors, SVC, Random Forest and XGBoost) to choose the models with the best results (best values for accuracy, precision and mean squared error); (v) I applied hyperparameter tuning, for two models, to improve my models choosing the best parameters values (used Randomized Search type); (vi) chose the best model, after the hyperparameter tuning and applied in test data (all the previous steps was did in train data with cross validation); (v) in the end, I created some graphs with the results to show the profile of survivors predicted.
